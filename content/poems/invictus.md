> _I am the Master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul..._

---

_Out of the night that covers me,_  
      _Black as the pit from pole to pole,_  
_I thank whatever gods may be_  
      _For my unconquerable soul._

_In the fell clutch of circumstance_  
      _I have not winced nor cried aloud._  
_Under the bludgeonings of chance_  
      _My head is bloody, but unbowed._

_Beyond this place of wrath and tears_  
      _Looms but the Horror of the shade,_  
_And yet the menace of the years_  
      _Finds and shall find me unafraid._

_It matters not how strait the gate,_  
      _How charged with punishments the scroll,_  
_I am the master of my fate,_  
      _I am the captain of my soul._

> By _W.E. Henley_
