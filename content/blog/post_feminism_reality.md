Ironically, the very socio-political movement that started out as a liberation
cry for women is now ending up as one of the most odious forms of oppression not
just for men but for women as well. There is no denying that men suffer far more
under the iron curtain of ***marxist feminism***; but for some odd reason, women
seem to be more miserable than ever. One of the worst thing western women could
have done is to bog themselves down in the tar pits chasing the feminist fantasy
that speaks to the very worst parts of the female psyche.

Indeed the entire reason that women have been such a previlaged class
throughout history is because only the good parts of her nature were displayed
openly in society for everyone to see. Feminism, for the first time in recorded
history has allowed western women to show their true nature. Now, the physical
beauty of women comes as a double edged sword of documented and well known
unbridled greed, manipulation and toxicity. Not since the days of Samson and
Delilah, have men been so keenly aware of the destruction and havoc women can
visit upon them. Women can no longer fetch the admiration and devotion of men
in a meaningful way without striking suspicion and caution.

> *"Ass and Tits and painted up faces that make them look
like clowns and heels that make them look taller than what they really are.
That's all they have left."*

Feminism, and the women who practice it are to blame. Not men. Feminism made
women absolutely unbearable to be around and impossible to form lasting bonds
with. By default, men categorize you as nothing but the very sex objects
feminists claim that patriarchy labelled you as. *That's why the western woman
is so intent on making sure that everybody notices her outfit that show just
enough ass and tits for plausible deniability - at work, on the streets, in the
supermarket, at the theaters and everywhere else. Because sex is all they are;
they have nothing else; Ass and Tits and painted up faces that make them look
like clowns and heels that make them look taller than what they really are.
That's all they have left.*

Some of the more perceptive western women are starting to realize the size and
scope of the trap they have been tricked into laying for themselves. But it
doesn't matter if they see it or not. For the first time, men are on the
precipice of adopting a line of thought that sticks a collective middle finger
at the faces of western femdom as a whole. The *Manginas* that haven't figured
out how much the very women they grovel to, in fact, despise them.

> *"God may forgive your
degeneracy but Men still know what you are, what you've done and more
importantly, who you've done."*

Women may have the governments catching them with their safety nets; but in
reality, all they can really do for them, is throw more money at the symptoms
of their misery. The feminist governments in the West (and increasingly more
and more places) are so good at hiding the fact that they are a huge part of
the very cause of a woman's sickness that she believes governments to be the
cure for. The Western skank is not going to be saved by the hordes of doctors
prescribing her more anti-depressants than ever; and she is not going to be
saved by going to church and expecting men to believe that that makes them
somehow cleanse of long list of men in her past. *God may forgive your
degeneracy, but Men still know what you are, what you've done and more
importantly, who you've done.*
