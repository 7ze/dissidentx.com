Follow along these guides as you see fit. A lot of the present configurations
that I use took me years of experience, trial and experimentation to build and
figure out. If there is someone out there on this same journey, some of these
guides may help you figure out stuff of your own. 

> Stay tuned, I always keep updating this.
